#Sport Analytics  

While Moneyball made the use of analytics in sports 
very popular, baseball is not the only sport for which 
analytics is used. Analytics is currently used in almost 
every single sport, including basketball, soccer, cricket, 
and hockey.  
- **Basketball**: The study of analytics in basketball, 
called *APBRmetrics*, is very popular.  
There have been many books written in this area, 
including "Pro Basketball Forecast" by John Hollinger 
and "Basketball on Paper" by Dean Oliver. 
There are also several websites dedicated to the study 
of basketball analytics, including [82games.com](82games.com). 
We'll talk more about basketball during recitation.  
- **Soccer**: The soccer analytics community is currently 
growing, and new data is constantly being collected. 
Many argue that it is much harder to apply analytics 
to soccer, but there are several books and websites on
the topic. Check out *The Numbers Game: Why Everything* 
*You Know about Football is Wrong* by Chris Anderson and 
David Sally, as well as the websites [socceranalysts.com](socceranalysts.com) 
and [soccermetrics.net](soccermetrics.net).  
- **Cricket**: There are several websites dedicated to building 
models for evaluating player performance in cricket. 
Check out [cricmetric.com](cricmetric.com) and 
[impactindexcricket.com](impactindexcricket.com).  
- **Hockey**: Analytics are used in hockey to track player 
performance and to better shape the composition of teams.
