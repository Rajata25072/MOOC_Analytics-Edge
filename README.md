This repository contains the code example and assignment files from MOOC offered by MIT, *Analytics Edge*, which I have worked through in [edX](https://www.edx.org/course/analytics-edge-mitx-15-071x-2).

The course comprises of 9 units (with unit 1 - 7 in *R* and 8 - 9 in *MS Excel*) which are 
- Unit1_Introduction
- Unit2_Linear Regression
- Unit3_Logistic Regression
- Unit4_Trees
- Unit5_Text Analytics
- Unit6_Clustering
- Unit7_Visualization
- Unit8_Linear Optimization
- Unit9_Integer Optimization

Upoen Completing the study unit, I also did the Final Exam and kaggle Com as shown in other 2 directories

In each course directory, there are mostly 3 types of file:  
- Assn = Assignment (code and .xlsx file)
- Ho = Files related to handout (Handout and code)  
- Re = Files related to recitation (Handout and code)
- .csv files are mostly data used
