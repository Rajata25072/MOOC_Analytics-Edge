# Quick Question
# In the previous video, we computed the following confusion matrix for our logistic regression model
# on our test set with a threshold of 0.5:
#   
# FALSE  TRUE
# 0	1069	6
# 1	187	11
# 
# Using this confusion matrix, answer the following questions.
# 
# What is the sensitivity of our logistic regression model on the test set, using a threshold of 0.5?
 11/(187+11) #0.05555556
# 
# 
 What is the specificity of our logistic regression model on the test set, using a threshold of 0.5?
 1069/(1069+6) #0.9944186

 
#  Quick Question
#  In Video 3, we built a logistic regression model and found that the following variables were 
#  significant (or almost significant) for predicting ten year risk of CHD: 
#   male, 
#   age, 
#   number of cigarettes per day, 
#   whether or not the patient previously had a stroke, 
#   whether or not the patient is currently hypertensive, 
#   total cholesterol level, 
#   systolic blood pressure, 
#   and blood glucose level. 
#  
#  Which one of the following variables would be the most dramatically affected by a 
#  behavioral intervention? 
#  HINT: Think about how much control the patient has over each of the variables.
 number of cigarettes per day,
 total cholesterol level
 lood glucose level
